# WebBank
This is an old project I created a long time ago for playing with friends. Just a simple pretend bank. It of course, lacks really any security in the long run. 
I just figured I should post this here for others to look at and play with ( as I made it for ). I had it posted on my GitHub page, but I closed my GitHub account
recently, and so I decided to migrate this over to here.

# Updates?
Maybe. I am thinking about possibly redoing this project. More formally, this time. I know it's just a silly little project, but I had fun making it. Perhaps it could
have some use. A small virtual money system for a group. I don't know! It is fun for me to make, so that's good enough ( haha ).

If I do update it, it will likely take quite some time. Redesigning this entire system will be a practice project for me. That means implementing all the proper
security a web service needs. SQL injection protetion, account verification, etc. That all takes quite some time. I'll be posting code-in-progress on a beta branch,
and eventually to 2.0 branch ( or pushing the current code to a legacy branch? )

# Security?
HAHAHA! There is no security in this project. This was written years ago, I was maybe ten or so when I wrote this. I don't think the system even hashes passwords!
There is no security! This is the time when I was still learning a lot of PHP, and did my website authentication a lot of the time in JavaScript. Yah, I know.
Anyways, there is absoultly zero security in this project. It's fun for just playing around, but for the love of god, in the current state, don't use it for
anything more!

# MyBank 2
This is a rewrite of a small pretend banking website I created a while ago.
The old version was written in PHP and horribly designed. This version is going to be written in Node.JS
and focous on making the website something that could actually be functional! 

# Uses
This application has no major real-world applications. It is mostly just an application I am writing for fun.
However, there are a few select cases where the software could be used. For example, in clubs or schools where
some sort of reward-economy exists, the framework is all available. Stores can easily be created to take advantage
of the REST APIs I plan on implementing. Same with schools, allowing for easy reward systems. Administrative users
can create as much money as they want, and add support for automatic money creation with web hooks.

# Documentation
More documentation will be created as I write more code. However, for documentation, check the docs folder.
